## Notes

##### Day 01

Nice simple day, used OOP for the elves.

##### Day 02

Making use of the enums from php 8.1

##### Day 03

Array intersect dealt with most of the task, then a method to tweak the result of `ord` to match the specified values in the task

##### Day 04

Not much to say here, just a couple of if statements... A bit of regex for the parsing I suppose.

##### Day 05

Parsing the data was the main time sink here, also my standard load method trims so that caused issues as well.

##### Day 06

Unusually simple. I assume it's the basis for future tasks.

##### Day 07

Used a nested data structure with reference to parent object. Once the data was loaded the tasks were really straight forward.
